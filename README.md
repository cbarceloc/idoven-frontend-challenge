# React Coding Challenge - ECG Visualizer

## Overview

This project is designed as a coding challenge to visualize an Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal using React. The application allows users to view and navigate an ECG recording interactively, with the ability to zoom in and out, and pan across the signal for a user-friendly experience.

## Features

Navigate through the signal (backward and forward).  
Zoom in and out of the signal.  
Select an area of the signal to zoom into.  
Use a clean, modular code structure with meaningful unit tests.
